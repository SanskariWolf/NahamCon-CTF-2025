## Challenge Description

WOW!! Look at all these free flags!!
But... wait a second... only one of them is right??
I will put a "max attempts" limit on this challenge at 1:00 PM Pacific to stop participants from automating submissions. There is only one correct flag, you can find a needle in a haystack if you really know what you are looking for.
